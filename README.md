# 📚 InReader

> A modern, keyboard-driven RSS feed reader that brings back the magic of Google Reader with AI! 🚀

InReader combines the beloved simplicity of Google Reader with modern features like AI-powered summaries, chat capabilities, and a beautiful dark mode. Perfect for power users who love keyboard shortcuts and AI enthusiasts who want to chat with their articles!

**All data is stored locally in your browser.** Feeds, articles, read/star state, AI summaries, chat history, and your interest profile all live in IndexedDB — nothing is sent to a remote server. Your reading data stays on your device.

### 🔄 Technical Features
#### Feed System
- Parallel feed refresh with stalled entry detection
- Smart duplicate entry detection
- Automatic metadata extraction
- Unread count tracking with visual indicators

#### Article Management
- Full article content extraction with RSS preview fallback
- Read/unread and star/favorite system
- Multiple viewing options (inline, new tab, reusable window)
- Processing status indicators with error handling

#### AI & TTS Integration
- **Three AI providers** — Ollama (local/LAN), OpenAI, or Anthropic Claude
- **Ollama** runs entirely on your own hardware for full privacy; supports LAN servers (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:11434`)
- **OpenAI / Claude** require an API key and send article content to external APIs for processing
- Configurable models per task (separate models for summaries and chat)
- Streaming chat responses with history tracking
- Queue-based TTS playback with progress tracking
- Automatic duplicate detection in TTS queue

#### Interest Tagging & Recommendations
- AI summaries automatically extract topic tags from each article (3–8 tags per article)
- Starring or listening to an article adds its tags to your interest profile
- All tagged articles are scored against your profile — higher overlap means a higher score
- The **Recommended** sidebar view surfaces unread articles ranked by interest score
- Manage your interest profile in the AI Configuration → Recommendations tab: view collected tags with counts, delete individual tags, re-score entries, or clear the entire profile

#### OPML Import & Export
- **Import** — Load subscriptions from any standard OPML file exported by another feed reader. Feeds are mapped to folders based on the OPML outline structure, and duplicates are skipped automatically.
- **Export** — Download all your current subscriptions as an `.opml` file for backup or migration to another reader.
- Access both via the folder icon in the Subscriptions sidebar header.

#### Data & Search
- IndexedDB storage with automatic migrations
- Efficient batch operations and caching
- Full-text search with history tracking
- Result count and recency tracking

### 🎨 Visual Indicators

#### Feed Badge Colors
The unread count badge for each feed changes color based on the most recent unread entry:
- **Dark Purple** - Content from the last hour
- **Dark Blue** - Content from the last 24 hours
- **Light Blue** - Content from the last week
- **Gray** - Older content

This color-coding system helps you quickly identify feeds with fresh content and prioritize your reading.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for development)
- Docker (for production deployment)
- AI provider (optional): Ollama (local), an OpenAI API key, or an Anthropic API key

### Quick Start - Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server (frontend + backend)
npm run dev
```

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/JamesDavid/InReader)

Or deploy manually:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

### Docker Deployment (Self-hosted)
```bash
# Build and run with HTTPS (self-signed certificate)
docker-compose up --build

# Access at https://localhost:8443
# For network access: https://YOUR_IP:8443

# Use a custom port
PORT=9443 docker-compose up --build

# Run in background
docker-compose up -d

# Stop
docker-compose down
```

> **Note:** Docker uses a self-signed SSL certificate. Accept the browser warning on first access.

### AI Configuration
Click the lightning bolt icon in InReader to choose a provider and configure models.

#### Ollama (local / LAN — fully private)
1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) on your machine or a server on your LAN
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2` (or any preferred model)
3. For LAN access, start Ollama with: `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ollama serve`
4. Enter your Ollama server URL:
   - Local: `http://localhost:11434`
   - LAN: `http://192.168.x.x:11434` (your server's IP)

> **Note:** For Vercel deployments, your Ollama server must be publicly accessible. For Docker/self-hosted, LAN servers work via the built-in proxy.

#### OpenAI
1. Enter your OpenAI API key
2. Select models for summaries and chat (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`)

#### Anthropic Claude
1. Enter your Anthropic API key
2. Select models for summaries and chat (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)

> **Privacy note:** Ollama keeps all processing on your own hardware. OpenAI and Claude send article content to external APIs. All other data (feeds, read state, stars, interest profile) is always stored locally regardless of AI provider.

## Tech Stack
- React 18
- TypeScript (strict)
- Tailwind CSS
- Dexie.js (IndexedDB)
- Vite
- Express.js (backend API) — the feed/article/AI-proxy endpoints validate and
  resolve outbound URLs to prevent SSRF, with request timeouts and response
  size caps
- Vitest (unit tests), ESLint (flat config), GitHub Actions CI
- Docker + nginx
- HTTPS with self-signed certificates

## Development & Quality

```bash
npm run dev      # frontend (Vite, :5173) + backend (Express, :3000)
npm run lint     # ESLint (flat config), zero-warnings
npm test         # Vitest unit tests
npm run build    # tsc typecheck + production Vite build
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, tests, the typecheck+build, and a
backend syntax check on every push and pull request.
